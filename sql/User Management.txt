			MySQL Create User


Syntax:CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] account_name IDENTIFIED BY 'password';  


MySQL CREATE USER Example

The following are the step required to create a new user in the MySQL server database.

Step 1: Open the MySQL server by using the mysql client tool.

Step 2: Enter the password for the account and press Enter.

Enter Password: ********  

Step 3: Execute the following command to show all users in the current MySQL server.

mysql> select user from mysql.user;  

Step 4: Create a new user with the following command.

mysql> create user peter@localhost identified by 'jtp12345';  

In the above output, we can see that the user peter has been created successfully.

Step 5: Now, we will use the IF NOT EXISTS clause with the CREATE USER statement.

mysql> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS adam@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'jtp123456';  
			
			MySQL Drop User

Syntax:DROP USER 'account_name';  
Example:DROP USER martin@localhost;  

			MySQL Show Users
mysql> SELECT user, host, account_locked, password_expired FROM user;  

			Show Current User
syntex:	
mysql> Select user();  
         or,  
mysql> Select current_user();  

			Show Current Logged User
syntex:mysql> SELECT user, host, db, command FROM information_schema.processlist;  

			Change MySQL User Password
MySQL allows us to change the user account password in three different ways, which are given below:

UPDATE Statement
SET PASSWORD Statement
ALTER USER Statement

		Change user account password using the UPDATE statement
syntex:mysql> 
USE mysql;  
   
mysql> UPDATE user SET password = PASSWORD('jtp12345') WHERE user = 'peter' AND host = 'localhost';  
   
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  

		Change user account password using SET PASSWORD statement

syntex:SET PASSWORD FOR 'peter'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('jtp12345');  
example:SET PASSWORD FOR 'peter'@'localhost' = jtp12345;  

		Change user account password using ALTER USER statement

Syntex:ALTER USER peter@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'jtp123';
