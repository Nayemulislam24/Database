					simple join
select students.roll,reg_number,name,gender,group_name,gpa
from students,exam_result
where students.roll = exam_result.roll;

					join cluses use
select stud.roll,exam.reg_number,stud.name,stud.gender,exam.group_name,exam.gpa

SELECT customers.customer_id, cust_name, price, date  
FROM customers  
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;  


				practical left join

select stud.roll,exam.reg_number,stud.name,stud.gender,exam.group_name,exam.gpa

SELECT customers.customer_id, cust_name, price, date  
FROM customers  
RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id  
ORDER BY  customer_id;  
OR,

SELECT customers.customer_id, cust_name, price, date  
FROM customers  
RIGHT JOIN orders USING(customer_id)  
ORDER BY  customer_id;
