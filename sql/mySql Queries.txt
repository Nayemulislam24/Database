				MySQL Queries	

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
AUTO_INCREMENT


				MySQL INSERT Statement

Syntax:
The below is generic syntax of SQL INSERT INTO command to insert a single record in MySQL table:

INSERT INTO table_name ( field1, field2,...fieldN )    
VALUES    
( value1, value2,...valueN );   


Example:
1. If we want to store single records for all fields, use the syntax as follows:

INSERT INTO People (id, name, occupation, age)   
VALUES (101, 'Peter', 'Engineer', 32);  

Syntax:
If we want to insert multiple records within a single command, use the following statement:

INSERT INTO table_name VALUES  
( value1, value2,...valueN )  
( value1, value2,...valueN )  
...........  
( value1, value2,...valueN );

Example:
2. If we want to store multiple records, use the following statements where we can either specify all field names or don't specify any field.

INSERT INTO People VALUES  
(102, 'Joseph', 'Developer', 30),  
(103, 'Mike', 'Leader', 28),  
(104, 'Stephen', 'Scientist', 45);     

				MySQL UPDATE Query

Syntax:
Following is a generic syntax of UPDATE command to modify data into the MySQL table:

UPDATE table_name     
SET column_name1 = new-value1,   
        column_name2=new-value2, ...    
[WHERE Clause]  


Example:
Update Single Column

This query will update the email id of Java course with the new id as follows:

UPDATE trainer    
SET email = 'mike@tutorialandexamples.com'    
WHERE course_name = 'Java';  

 				MySQL DELETE Statement

Syntax:

The following are the syntax that illustrates how to use the DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;  
Example:
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE emp_id=107; 
 
MySQL DELETE and LIMIT Clause
DELETE FROM table_name  
WHERE condition   
ORDER BY colm1, colm2, ...  
LIMIT row_count;  


DELETE FROM Employees ORDER BY name LIMIT 3;  

				MySQL SELECT Statement




SELECT Statement Syntax
It is the most commonly used SQL query. The general syntax of this statement to fetch data from tables are as follows:

SELECT field_name1, field_name 2,... field_nameN   
FROM table_name1, table_name2...  
[WHERE condition]  
[GROUP BY field_name(s)]  
[HAVING condition]   
[ORDER BY field_name(s)]  
[OFFSET M ][LIMIT N];  

Syntax for all fields:
SELECT * FROM tables [WHERE conditions]  
[GROUP BY fieldName(s)]  
[HAVING condition]   
[ORDER BY fieldName(s)]  
[OFFSET M ][LIMIT N];  

				MySQL REPLACE

Syntax:

The following are the syntax of REPLACE statement in MySQL:

REPLACE [INTO] table_name(column_list)  
VALUES(value_list);  
Example:
REPLACE INTO Person (id, city)  
VALUES(4,'Amsterdam');
